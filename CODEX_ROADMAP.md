## Active Phase â€” RC5 Observability & Documentation (ðŸŸ¢)

### Objectives
- Deliver first-class observability: Prometheus exporter, Grafana dashboards, alerting recipes.
- Stand up a comprehensive documentation portal (install guides, NovaFile reference, troubleshooting playbooks).
- Equip support with log bundle tooling, diagnostics commands, and escalation workflows.
- Fold community feedback loops into RC5 deliverables (docs issue triage, telemetry-driven improvements).

### Workstreams
1. **Metrics Platform** â€“ Prometheus scrape endpoint, exporter configuration, optional Grafana bundle.
2. **Documentation Portal** â€“ mdBook/Docusaurus build pipeline, content migration, versioned publishing.
3. **Support Tooling** â€“ Log bundle generator, `nova diag` commands, error glossary automation.
4. **Feedback & Adoption** â€“ Community office hours, docs analytics, success metrics instrumentation.

### Sprint 0 Kickoff (Week 1)
- Create `rc5-observability` GitHub Project board with swimlanes and automation hooks.
- Assign DRIs:
  - Metrics Platform â†’ @observability-crew
  - Documentation Portal â†’ @docs-tiger-team
  - Support Tooling â†’ @support-core
  - Feedback & Adoption â†’ @community-ops
- Finalize metrics schema (host, VM, container, network) and alert thresholds.
- Choose documentation stack (mdBook vs Docusaurus) and bootstrap theme aligned with Nova branding.
- Schedule weekly metrics/docs sync plus bi-weekly customer advisory review.

### Upcoming Sprint Backlog (Weeks 2-3)
- Metrics Platform: implement exporter prototype, add integration tests, produce default Grafana dashboards.
- Documentation Portal: migrate existing markdown, set up navigation/search, add CI link checker + spell check.
- Support Tooling: design log bundle schema, implement `nova support bundle` CLI, document redaction story.
- Feedback & Adoption: launch docs feedback widget, prepare beta program announcements, collect telemetry for doc search queries.

### Dependencies & Staffing
- Requires telemetry endpoints from monitoring module (completed during RC4) plus network stats parity.
- Documentation stack hosting (GitHub Pages/S3) coordination with infra.
- Security review for log bundle contents (avoid sensitive data leakage).
- Design resources for docs theming and dashboard polish.

### Key Deliverables
- `nova-metrics` exporter enabled via config, with sample Grafana dashboards committed to `docs/`.
- Docs site (docs.nova.dev) with install, NovaFile spec, CLI reference, troubleshooting, and API overview.
- `nova support bundle` command bundling logs, configs, and diagnostics with redaction options.
- Community rollout plan: office hours, changelog updates, onboarding emails, docs analytics dashboard.

### Exit Criteria
- Metrics endpoint gated behind config flag, validated on Arch/Ubuntu hosts (single-node + multi-node) with automated tests.
- Documentation portal live with versioned releases and automated publishing pipeline in CI.
- Support tooling adopted by maintainers; sample ticket resolved using new bundle + docs flow.
- Satisfaction signals: â‰¥80% positive feedback from RC5 advisory group, no open `rc5-blocker` issues.

### Metrics & Signals
- Prometheus scrape success rate â‰¥99% across nightly CI runs.
- Docs site uptime via synthetic check; analytics capturing search-to-click success â‰¥70%.
- Support bundle usage tracked (opt-in telemetry) with <5% failure rate.
- Feedback backlog triaged within 48 hours, status visible on project board.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Dashboard bloat** â†’ curate default panels, document customization, run usability reviews.
- **Docs drift** â†’ enforce docs-as-code workflow, add PR checklist items, automate stale content alerts.
- **Sensitive data leakage** â†’ implement redaction rules, run security review, add `--scrub` flag to bundles.
- **Adoption lag** â†’ pair metrics/docs release with webinars, provide quick-start videos, capture community questions.

### Coordination & Reporting
- Daily stand-up remains 10:30 UTC with rotating note taker; highlights mirrored to `SNAPSHOTS.md` weekly.
- Metrics/demo review every other Friday featuring exporter status and docs site walkthroughs.
- Risk register reviewed Mondays; blockers escalated in `#nova-rc5` with 24h SLA.
- Dedicated Grafana dashboard tracks exporter health, docs analytics, and support bundle adoption.

## Phase Retrospective â€” RC4 Experience Upgrade

- Completed: `nova wizard vm` CLI delivering diffable NovaFile snippets with apply/dry-run flows; GUI wizard foundations integrated.
- Delivered template metadata registry scaffolding and version checks; baseline gallery populated with curated stacks.
- Embedded real-time metrics panels and topology readouts; added async task executor improvements to avoid UI stalls.
- Accessibility audit closed high-contrast issues, keyboard navigation gaps, and notification UX polish; documentation drafted for RC5 hand-off.
- Lessons: invest in reusable validation libraries for both CLI and GUI, align template metadata workflow early with community maintainers, and co-schedule telemetry with GUI changes for testing efficiency.

## Phase Retrospective â€” RC3 Networking & Infrastructure Parity

- Completed: `nova network` CLI + libvirt commands, NetworkManager refresh, DHCP/NAT scaffolding, GUI status indicators, and namespace-backed integration suite.
- Lessons: invest early in host-variance testing (Arch + Ubuntu benches), maintain idempotent command design, and document prerequisites prominently.
- Follow-ups: finish publishing networking cookbook, expand dry-run/no-op options, and monitor autostart telemetry during RC4.

## Upcoming Phase â€” RC6 Hardening & Release Packaging (âšª)

### Focus Areas
- Security review of the expanded observability stack (Prometheus endpoints, support bundles) including threat modeling, dependency scanning, and RBAC validation.
- Packaging and distribution: Flatpak/AppImage/tarball builds, signed checksums/SBOM, systemd units, and guided upgrade tooling.
- Performance regression benchmarking across VM/container startup, exporter overhead, and docs site build times.

### Dependencies
- RC5 deliverables (metrics exporter, docs site, support tooling) stabilized and annotated with ownership.
- Infrastructure sign-off for artifact hosting (package repo, CDN) and key management for signing.
- Coordinated security review bandwidth (internal + external) and access to dependency SBOM tooling.

### Exit Criteria
- Security issues identified are mitigated or accepted with documented rationale; SECURITY.md updated.
- Reproducible build pipeline produces signed artifacts and SBOMs validated in CI and release dry runs.
- Performance baselines established with automated regression gates in CI (tolerances agreed upon with product).

---

## 1.0 GA â€” Launch Readiness (âšª)

### Goals
- Tag v1.0.0, publish release notes, migration guide, and hosted binaries.
- Stand up support channels (forum, issue triage rotations) and maintenance cadence.
- Capture retrospective and plan post-GA backlog (minor releases, long-term support strategy).

### Exit Criteria
- GA checklist signed by engineering, product, design, and support.
- Monitoring/alerting dashboards operational for production deployments.
- Post-release roadmap drafted for 1.1+ features.

---

## Cross-Phase Operating Principles

- **Quality Gates**: Every PR must pass `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`, `cargo test`, integration suites (network namespaces, libvirt smoke), and UI lint/screenshot tests once RC5 lands.
- **Documentation Discipline**: Update README excerpts, SNAPSHOTS, and docs site whenever behavior changes; include migration notes for breaking changes.
- **Telemetry First**: Instrument new features with `tracing` spans and metrics before feature freeze; avoid retrofitting after the fact.
- **Security Mindset**: Run `cargo audit` weekly, capture threat model updates per milestone, and document mitigations in SECURITY.md.
- **Feedback Loop**: Close the loop with community interviews and issue reviews at the end of each RC; feed insights into backlog grooming.

---

## Supporting Workstreams

- **Testing & Automation**: Maintain nightly regression matrix (Arch/Ubuntu, GPU presence, libvirt availability). Add scenario-specific fixtures as new features land.
- **Documentation & Comms**: Publish fortnightly status updates in `SNAPSHOTS.md`, keep ROADMAP and CODEX aligned, and prep release notes early.
- **Community & Support**: Label roadmap input (`roadmap-input`), track beta champions, and schedule bi-weekly office hours.
- **Risk & Issue Management**: Maintain risk register with owner/mitigation, review weekly during RC phases, and escalate blockers within 24h.

This codex stays dynamicâ€”update it at the close of each sprint or milestone review so everyone shares the same execution picture.
